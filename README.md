# Advent-of-code

## 2022

All Rust!

## 2021

Gave AoC 2021 a Go. It was not for me, and I soon changed into TypeScript code running in Deno instead.

## 2020

I was new to Python when beginning this year's AoC. After 43 stars I feel I'm starting to know the language pretty well!
(And some Ruby, TypeScript and F# as well.)

## 2019

Trying this year's AoC in Haskell. Getting a suprising amount of correct answers!

## 2018

Warm-up in Rust.
